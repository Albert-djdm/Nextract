This code originates from the method I used during the diHub Hackaton on text Mining. The goal of this 
code was to extract the issuer of a set of securties. All those documents are confidential so the 
example provided cannot be run, on the final test set the code achieved 90% of accuracy.

This is the re-factored version with some simplifications, generalization, corrections
and improvement and a lot more comments. On the training set, the accuracy rose from 90% to 95%
with this version. I, however, did not re-test on the final set by lack of time (and now I don't have
anymore access to the data...).

I intend to further work on this, particularly see if I can automatize the algorithm learning and 
found new applications... For now, I release it on GitHub for those hoe are interested.

Look at the ipython Issuer_example.ipynb for a example of use.
